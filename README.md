Don't expect any greatness from this project in the near future. I just started development. And 
some of the skills required aren't exactly my strong points. There is a fair probability that this 
will never go anywhere. 

## Aim ##

The aim of this game is to create a turn based erotic role-playing game with a focus on story 
telling that supports a wide range of fetish settings.

In order to comply with open source requirements and age restrictions at the same time, the code 
will not contain any adult content. All adult content will be provided through a different mechanism 
and will have to be imported into the finished game. But this is all fancy future - at the moment 
there is no content whatsoever and bigger things have to be solved first.

## Helping ##

I'm not keen to have people offer their help until I've figured out the basic structure of the game 
and implemented it. However, if you are very keen to help you can drop me a message. If our aims 
align, if you understand that things might change quite a bit whenever I discover that my initial 
concept wasn't going to work and if I'm convinced that you'll be able to help in a significant way 
then I'm happy to accept help even at this stage. In general, people with GUI experience and/or 
artwork skills and/or story telling skills will be particularly appreciated.
